  <h1>Created by DIY super parents and pet owners.</h1>
  <p>We created Viyo with the goal of seamlessly balancing your work and home life. Like many others who are part of the new gig economy, there's no hard separation between our home and work lives.</p>
  <p>
  We wanted to create a low-barrier solution for parents and pet owners just like us—so you don't have to shell out hundreds of dollars on dedicated hardware and pay for features you don't need.</p>

  <h1>A browser-based home monitoring solution with privacy and security at its very core.</h1>
  <p>In today's world, the video monitoring industry is dominated by large companies that access and sell your data. They make you choose between your security and your privacy. You shouldn’t have to make that compromise.</p>
<p>
As parents and pet-owners ourselves, we take privacy seriously—especially when it comes to the most personal and sensitive area of your life. That's why we built Viyo as a browser-based app so none of your data has to be stored on servers. Click here to learn more about how Viyo works and how it protects your data.</p>
